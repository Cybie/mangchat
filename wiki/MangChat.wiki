IRC Client For Project MaNGOS


= History =
{{{
The reason to write the first mangchat was a combined
me wanting to learn the sockets library crossplatform
and the idea of creating a irclient inside mangos to 
be able to have simple chat between wow and irc and 
connecting the channels of multiple mangos and irc 
servers in one network having "cross-server chat" and
also the posibility to execute simple gm commands.

I learned a little bit about the sockets library
and some people where happy with this new functionality
and someone pointed me out maybe others would like it 
and there MangChat was born and released to the community

Due to a lot of work in real life i was unfortunatly 
a while unable to work on it, I gues it became pretty populair
and luckly there where people that added a lot more options 
to MangChat known as the Ehanced version.
Lice <lice@yeuxverts.net>
Dj_baby
Sanaell
Death420

And they have done a great job in extending MangChat
having almost full GM control, and the irc user system
and many other great improvements, they where the one
that kept MangChat alive.


From the moment i had written this extension it was
was done "as fast as possbile to make it work coding"
hehe, anyways and i always wanted to make it better
and easier to use this made me write MangChat 1.0.
i started with a fresh mangos source


A BIG thanks goes to Brunogcar who took the time todo
the stuff i was too lazy for *evil grin* mainly using the
search button finding me information  and stuff ;)
Thanks my friend.

with help and support from the MaNGOS project community.
